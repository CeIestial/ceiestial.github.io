## Hello world, I am CeIestial.

I am a person that is learning about digital hardware design.

This will be a daily blog written in 15 minutes. No more, no less.

It will feature everything from to do list to problems I dealt with that day to personal rambles I feel the need to write out.

I hope that I can document the mutual problems we might face and possibly provide possible solutions.


# As of July, 2022 :

My current interests are in Digital Hardware System Design, focusing on mutual improvements in SoC(FPGA and ASIC) and algorithms(AI, ML).

My topics will be about FPGA implementation with Verilog HDL and Vivado tool, hardware design and validation with Cadence/Synopsys, C/C++ programming, and Computer Systems.

Along with everything else.


## Information/Contacts
My professional information is offered at [my weekly blog](https://hyunseokerikjung.github.io).
